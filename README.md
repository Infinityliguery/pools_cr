  "readme_content": "# pools_cr: Cross-Chain Bridge Event Listener Simulation\n\nThis repository contains a Python script that simulates the core logic of a relayer node for a cross-chain bridge. It is designed to be a robust, architecturally sound component for a decentralized system, demonstrating best practices in modular design, state management, and error handling.\n\n## Concept\n\nA cross-chain bridge allows users to transfer assets or data from one blockchain (the \"source chain\") to another (the \"destination chain\"). A common pattern is the \"lock-and-mint\" mechanism:\n\n1.  A user deposits assets into a smart contract on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum). This action emits a `TokensDeposited` event.\n2.  A network of off-chain nodes, called \"relayers\" or \"oracles,\" listens for this event.\n3.  After waiting for a certain number of block confirmations to ensure the transaction is final and not part of a chain reorganization (re-org), a relayer will submit a transaction to a corresponding smart contract on the destination chain (e.g., Polygon).\n4.  This transaction calls a `mint` function, creating a wrapped or synthetic version of the asset on the destination chain and sending it to the user's address.\n\nThis script simulates the logic of **Steps 2, 3, and 4**: the relayer node that securely and reliably transfers the event information from the source chain to the destination chain.\n\n## Code Architecture\n\nThe script is designed with a clear separation of concerns, with each class handling a specific responsibility. This makes the system easier to understand, maintain, and extend.\n\n```\n[ Main (script.py) ]\n       |\n       +--> instantiates --> [ ConfigManager ]  (Handles .env loading and validation)\n       |\n       +--> instantiates --> [ CrossChainProcessor ] (The main orchestrator)\n                                |\n                                +---> [ EventScanner (for Source Chain) ]\n                                |         |--> uses --> [ BlockchainConnector ]\n                                |\n                                +---> [ TransactionRelayer (for Dest Chain) ]\n                                |         |--> uses --> [ BlockchainConnector ]\n                                |\n                                +--> calls --> run() [Main execution loop]\n```\n\n*   **`ConfigManager`**: A centralized class for loading, accessing, and validating all configuration parameters from a `.env` file. It ensures the application doesn't start with missing critical information.\n\n*   **`BlockchainConnector`**: Manages the connection to a single blockchain via its RPC URL. It initializes the `web3` instance and loads the necessary smart contract ABI, providing a ready-to-use contract object.\n\n*   **`EventScanner`**: The heart of the listening mechanism. It scans the source chain for new blocks, filters for the specific `TokensDeposited` event, and manages a list of \"pending\" events. It is responsible for handling block confirmations.\n\n*   **`TransactionRelayer`**: Responsible for all write operations on the destination chain. It takes confirmed event data, constructs a new transaction (`mintBridgedTokens`), signs it with the relayer's private key, and broadcasts it to the network. It also handles nonce management.\n\n*   **`CrossChainProcessor`**: The main orchestrator. It initializes all other components and contains the main application loop. It gets confirmed events from the `EventScanner` and passes them to the `TransactionRelayer` for processing, ensuring that each event is processed only once.\n\n## How it Works\n\nThe script follows a continuous execution cycle:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The script starts by loading all required configuration from the `.env` file using the `ConfigManager`.\n\n2.  **State Restoration**: The `EventScanner` loads the last block number it scanned from a local file (`scanner_state.json`). This ensures that if the script is restarted, it doesn't re-process old events and can resume where it left off.\n\n3.  **Health Check**: Before each scanning cycle, the `CrossChainProcessor` performs a basic health check on both the source and destination chain RPC endpoints using the `requests` library. If an endpoint is down, it will pause and retry later.\n\n4.  **Scanning Loop**: The `EventScanner` queries the source chain for new blocks since the last scan. It fetches event logs for the configured bridge contract.\n\n5.  **Event Detection & Confirmation**: Any new `TokensDeposited` events are added to a `pending_events` dictionary. The script then checks this dictionary against the latest block number. If an event's block number is older than the current block by at least `CONFIRMATION_BLOCKS`, it is considered final and moved to a \"confirmed\" list.\n\n6.  **Relaying**: The `CrossChainProcessor` iterates through the confirmed events. For each event, it ensures it hasn't been processed before (using an in-memory cache) and then instructs the `TransactionRelayer` to build, sign, and send the corresponding `mintBridgedTokens` transaction to the destination chain.\n\n7.  **State Update**: After scanning a batch of blocks, the `EventScanner` saves the latest block number to `scanner_state.json`.\n\n8.  **Wait**: The script pauses for a configurable interval (`SCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS`) before starting the next cycle.\n\n## Usage Example\n\n### Prerequisites\n*   Python 3.8+ and `pip`\n*   Access to RPC endpoints for two EVM-compatible chains (e.g., from Infura, Alchemy, or a local node).\n*   A wallet private key with funds on the destination chain to pay for gas fees.\n\n### 1. Setup\n\nFirst, clone the repository and install the required dependencies in a virtual environment:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository (example)\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/pools_cr.git\ncd pools_cr\n\n# Create and activate a virtual environment\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n\n# Install Python dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### 2. Configuration\n\nCreate a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory and populate it with your specific details. **Never commit this file to version control.**\n\n```dotenv\n# .env file\n\n# RPC endpoint for the source chain (e.g., Ethereum, Goerli)\nSOURCE_CHAIN_RPC_URL=\"https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID\"\n\n# RPC endpoint for the destination chain (e.g., Polygon, Mumbai)\nDEST_CHAIN_RPC_URL=\"https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID\"\n\n# The private key of the account that will pay gas to submit minting transactions\n# IMPORTANT: Use a dedicated account with limited funds. Do NOT use your main wallet.\nRELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=\"0x...your_private_key...\"\n\n# Address of the bridge contract on the source chain\nSOURCE_BRIDGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=\"0x...source_contract_address...\"\n\n# Address of the bridge contract on the destination chain\nDEST_BRIDGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=\"0x...destination_contract_address...\"\n\n# Number of blocks to wait for confirmation on the source chain (protection against re-orgs)\nCONFIRMATION_BLOCKS=12\n\n# How many seconds to wait between scanning cycles\nSCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS=30\n```\n\n### 3.
